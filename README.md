# Features

* **Visualization**: Regplot and residplot to check linear assumption
* **Model Evaluation**: Mean Squared Error and R-squared tests for model evaluation
* **Data Visualization**: Scatter plot of data set with regression line for predictions as well as a text box with model evaluation metrics
